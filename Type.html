                <br /><p>Edward Hopper, a distinguished 20th century American realist painter
                    (Hopper, 2013), presents the idea of an emotional experience found through the
                    visual representations of art. Appealing to both the senses and the psyche art
                    shares a message which can have a profound personal impact.</p>
                <p>We can apply Hopper’s message to extend beyond paintings and traditional art
                    forms into the realm of typography. After all, the visual impact of words can be
                    just as powerful, if not more, than the content words represent. </p>
                <h3><b>What is Typography?</b></h3>
                <p>In our daily lives we encounter information in a variety of ways. Appealing to
                    auditory and visual senses, we hear, see and read information which links
                    together words to form syntax resulting in the conveyance of messages and ideas. </p>
                <p>Just as information is all around us, so too is typography, but what is it? While
                    there are several working definition, I would like to provide two which
                    encompass the wide ranging essence and functions of typography.</p>
                <p>First, the Merriam-Webster online dictionary states that typography is,<i>“the
                        style, arrangement, or appearance of printed letters on a page"</i>
                    (typography, n.d.). </p>
                <p>As this definition is specific to bodies of works in a printed format, I would
                    like to introduce a second definition which describes typography as the,
                        <i>“design or selection of letter forms to be organized into words and
                        sentences and printed or displayed electronically" </i>(Typography, 2012). </p>
                <p>Taken together we can recognize that typography is the overall aesthetic
                    representation of a body of text and is created through the process of design,
                    format, and arrangement of a document’s words and sentences. </p>
            </header>
            <h3>Brief Historical Overview</h3>
            <p>Typography originated with the establishment of printing in the 15th century and was
                composed of three typefaces: roman, italic, and black letter, which is also known as
                Gothic (Typography, 2012). </p>
            <p>Though there is a small body of empirical investigation which looks at typeface and
                visual-emotional and visual-psychological impact; previous studies of typography
                were largely conducted between the 1920s and 1980s (Brumberger, 208). Regardless of
                the extent of literature, these investigations provide substantially similar
                conclusions.</p>
            <p>The notion of understanding typefaces as a visual message has been present throughout
                history. Eva Brumberger provides a concise overview which drawn on examples from
                Ancient Greece and Rome wherein, <span class="quote">"serif letterforms were
                    considered 'symbols of the empire' whereas sans serif forms were considered
                    symbols of the Republic"</span>
                <span class="citation">(Brumberger, 207)</span>. She further discusses how this
                notion carried through the Renaissance,<span class="quote">"modem typographers to be
                    imbued with cultural and national characteristics"</span><span class="citation"
                    >(Brumberger, 207)</span>. Finally, she offers that typographers by the turn of
                the 20th century incurred a movement whereby "most designers wished to eradicate
                nationalistic characteristics... [to have] typefaces that were free of historical
                and cultural association" (Brumberger, 207). </p>
            <p>Traditionally, typography has encompassed elements of design and layout for printed
                materials, however, this practice now extends into the electronic world. Blogger and
                professional typographer, Kilian Muster proposes the grouping of several typography
                features into two major categories: micro-typography and macro-typography (Muster,
                2010). Using this framework I will briefly describe the elements of typography, and
                explain the emotional and psychological impact of typography. I will then conclude
                with reflection on why considerations of typography are essential to accessibility
                and usability of print and electronic resources. </p>
            <h3>Macro and Micro Typography</h3>
            <p>Oliver Reichenstein states "macro-typology [is the] overall text-structure in
                contrast to micro typology [which is the] detailed aspects of type and spacing"
                (Reichenstein, 2006). Kilian Muster also envisions macro-typography as</p>
            <div class="blockquote">“look[ing] at the big picture of communication such as line
                length, margins, line height (leading), balance of text and images, how to use white
                space, font sizing/weighting, and the layout as such" (Muster, 2010).</div>
            <p>For instance, line height, which is referred to as leading is an element which
                determines the amount of space between each line of text. By decreasing leading,
                lines are closer together, which create a compact text-block, however this may also
                "increase the pace of the reader and invoke the feeling of cramped conditions and
                claustrophobia, which can be desired when you are using type in this expressive
                manner" (Bailey, 2011). </p>
            <figure class="right">
                <a href="typography4.svg">
                    <img src="typography4.svg" alt="Typography" width="300" height="100" />
                </a>
                <figcaption>Naylor, M.<br/><i>Typography Line Terms</i></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Oliver Reichenstein argues along similar lines of Muster and Bailey, that elements
                such as attention to balance of margins, text and images, use of white space, as
                well as font size and weight are critical to readability. However, he also suggests
                "a great web designer knows how to work with text not just content, he treats 'text
                as a user interface'" (Reichenstein, 2006). </p>
            <p>In contrast, micro-typology deals with a number of characteristics, as Kilian Muster
                suggests in his article <i>What is typography today,</i> which deal(ing) with minutiae of
                type and layout, such as selecting the fonts themselves, the kerning (spacing
                between letters), spacing (between words) and correct orthography" (K. Muster,
                2010).</p>
            <p>For instance, kerning distinguishes the space in between letters. In an article
                entitled <i>The Basics of Typography,</i> author Christian Bailey suggests that "kerning
                is the art of adjusting spacing between characters so that the eye can flow easily
                across the copy without being distracted by discrepancies" (Bailey, 2011). </p>
            <p>In addition, spacing, also known as tracking, refers to the space between words and
                can range from loose to tight, and it is suggested that the best practice in
                selecting tracking should be determined by readability (Bailey, 2011). </p>
            <p>Taken together, all characteristics of typography is the total structure and design
                of a text which, when optimized will also increase the optimization of readability,
                accessibility and usability (Reichenstein, 2006). Typography is not simply the type
                of font (typeface) one uses (Reichenstein, 2006), just as colour is not the only
                element in a painting. </p>
            <h3>Impact of Typography</h3>
            <p>Internationally renowned for her scholarship on typography, as well as the history of
                graphic design, experimental poetry, fine art, and digital humanities <span
                    class="citation">(Drucker, n.d.)</span>, Johanna Drucker suggests there is a
                    <span class="quote">"visual dimension of written language" and that those
                    "visual structures actually produce meaning"</span> (Drucker, 8). </p>
            <p>Drucker also views a strong link between language and experience (8). She describes
                the selection of different typefaces, in addition to altering both size and weight,
                as a method of visually describing characters in her work 26 '76. The typeface
                chosen visually expressed the content of language and characters, for instance, "the
                bolder face was used for the dark-haired characters, while the lighter face was
                reserved for the fair" (10). The techniques used in Drucker's innovative works
                illustrate the power of language from a visual perspective. How we view, interpret,
                and react to language directly correlates to the typography of the document, not
                just the font or weight of letters, but rather the way the text is conceptualized
                and executed. </p>

                <figcaption>PhilosDesign <br/><i>TypoGraphy</i></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>As Eva Brumberger maintains the advent of word processing and desktop software has
                increasingly placed design decisions in the hands of technical writers, for "in the
                past 'writers have not needed to think carefully about how the look of the page will
                affect the meaning of the text'" (Brumberger, 206). Increasingly, a number of
                studies and literature report a strong association between a reader's first
                impressions of a work and the typography selected to convoy an author's message.</p>
            <p>Authors, whether they print their work or display it electronically have the ability
                to create a message not only through content, but also through the craft of
                designing, selecting, and displaying their text. </p>
            <h4><i>Emotional and Psychological Impact</i></h4>
            <p>From the observer to the academic there is a consensus of emotional and psychological
                impact typography has on a reader. Kilian Muster argues that typography
                “accomodat[es] the human mind, making the reader read, the viewer watch (not only
                look), drawing and keeping the attention (Muster, 2010). Arguably, readers see the
                text before the read it, thus the first impression is created by the typography or
                "the arrangement of type" (Bailey, 2011). </p>
            <p>Further, Eva Brumberger presents a comprehensive empirical study which investigates
                and supports the theory that readers attribute a personality type to typography
                (Brumberger, 2003). The results from Brumberger's study conclude that participants
                "consistently ascribe particular personality attributes to a given typeface"
                (Brumberger, 213). There were eighteen typefaces which "sorted very cleanly into
                three categories"; elegance, directness and friendliness (Brumberger, 214).</p>
            <h3><b>Future Considerations</b></h3>
            <p>So where do we go from here? We have a basic idea of what typography is and how it
                affects reader perception; the question now is how do we harness the power of
                typography and for what purpose?</p>
            <p>The visual structures of macro and micro typology immediately impact viewers
                emotionally and psychologically. As such, there are a number of considerations to
                reflect upon when we create documents, either in print or on the web. </p>
            <p>First, we need to remember that typography, good or bad, provides an access point to
                a body of work. As has been suggested, typography presents a message of its own, one
                which should be harnessed by authors to accurately and effectively represent the
                content of their work. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and in this
                case, a thousand or more words can create a memorable picture, or first impression
                of the mood, connotation, tone, and style held within the document's content.</p>
            <p>Second, based on the proceeding body of research, evidence shows a strong link
                between emotion, perception and interpretation with the selection of typeface. To
                this end, further studies should be undertaken to ensure these conclusions remain
                valid, as well as provide current empirical data to support the proceeding body of
                literature. While many studies reviewed for the purpose of this paper have been
                concerned with the characteristic of typeface and the impact on readers, similarly
                it would be valuable to investigate the effect of colour on reader emotions and
                impressions. Perhaps in creating a base knowledge of the emotional and psychological
                effects of various characteristics on readers a concise set of best practices could
                be assumed.</p>
            <p>That said, it is also important to understand that generalizing the impact of
                individual typographic characteristics cannot accurately represent how culture, age,
                gender, educational background, and a number of other demographic qualifiers can
                also contribute to the overall impact of specific typographic features.</p>
            <p>Finally, authors, technical writers, and web designers need to reflect on technical
                considerations, such as web browser requirements which can hinder the overall
                typography of a work. In addition, we should also consider how the effect of
                typography may be conveyed in a way which is accessible to all individuals. For
                instance, for individuals with visual impairments, how can we convey the message
                both the content and appearance of words create through typography. </p>
            <p>When authors create content they aim to convey messages and ideas they have deemed
                important enough to be read. Thus, typography chosen to deliver that message is
                equally important. The conscious decision to design, select and arrange the
                appearance of letter is similar to the way an artist gathers the tools for his
                artwork. </p>
